I'm Steven, and I'm currently a neural data scientist and engineer at [Biological Black Box (BBB)](https://bbb-tech.com/) and work as a data manager for [Nucleate](https://nucleate.org/).

I received my PhD in Neuroscience from the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology in 2019, before moving to the USA to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Mind/Brain Institute at Johns Hopkins University.

I have experience in statistics, data analysis and machine learning and have delivered on complex projects in academia and industry, designing experiments and end-to-end data collection, processing, and analysis pipelines.

I work primarily in the Python ecosystem, and have experience in MATLAB and SQL. I am currently working through the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and learning how to incorporate Docker containers, infrastructure-as-code, and orchestration tools into my workflows.

You can connect with me, or learn more about my experience, at [homepage (under development)](https://sjjerjian.github.io) or on [LinkedIn]
